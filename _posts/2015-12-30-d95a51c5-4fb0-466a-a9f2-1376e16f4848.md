Chaos Red is the first half of the diptych "Chaos Red & Chaos Blue." It's a multiple exposure photograph made from stained glass at a church in Wrocław, Poland. The title relates to both the content of the piece and how it came to be. I had traveled across an ocean to visit Poland for my museum show, The Magic City at Stara Kopalnia, and Wrocław, the next big town, was on my bucket list. The short train ride from Wałbrzych where the museum is located passes through the site of the legendary Nazi Gold Train, which just happened to come to light the week I was there. Although the trip itself is not much more than hour, the process of getting around in this part of Poland can be logistically challenging. 

The first church on my list to photograph would not let me, or anyone else, in the door. A burly bouncer held up a cardboard sign, written in Sharpie, that said "CLOSED UNTIL TOMORROW." There was no tomorrow in Wrocław for me, but the bouncer wasn't having it. I never did find out what was going on there. The painfully beautiful, contemporary stained glass could be seen only from the back side, hardly worthy of shooting.

I could, however, spot the spires of another church not too many blocks away, so I made started a walk through the Wrocław's charming downtown area. It reminds me quite a bit of Brussels' Grand Place with great architecture and a charming café lifestyle. Alas, I could not, for all practical purposes, go in this church either... for they were holding a mass. Ok, no problem. I can certainly pass the time as a _flâneur _along European streets. It's one of my favorite things to do.

After a failed attempt at returning to the first church to try and sneak a way in, I again crossed the plaza only and made my way back to the second church to find myself an uninvited guest at a Polish wedding. And wedding photographs were not what I had in mind.

After ice cream (aahh... ice cream) and coffee (aahh... coffee!) I made a third stab at it, only to find another mass in progress. Poland is very serious about its old churches. They actually use them. Once I bothered to look at the mass schedule outside, it was clear it was going to be turtles all the way down.

My photographic technique is far from subtle, requiring as it does multiple shots of the same objects from various distances along with a fair amount of trekking back-and-forth between windows until I get the composition I want. This was not something I wanted to do in front of a Catholic mass, so I waited in the alcove until I could detect a break in the service. My Polish is not good enough to know exactly what spurred it on, but music and people moving around were enough to send me charging in for a least a few seconds. About 90 seconds. In other words, it took far longer to explain this picture to you than I was given to make it.

The resulting pair of pictures, Chaos Red & Chaos Blue, are meant to be displayed together. They're comprised of two shots each of two stained glass windows, one red and one blue. No matter how you place the pictures next to each other, chaos flows from one to the other.

While a whirling, chaotic, and colorful vision dominates this picture, notice the subtle grid which holds together the stained glass windows and the larger, girder-like elements which create an interrupted frame of reference. Visual perception and how it evolves and devolves from structure are a big theme in my work and one that I want to continue to pursue.
